## Experience

My experience with this project was moslty good. A bunch of the stuff for express, pug, and SQL still confuse me, especially express, but I was able to mostly complete the lab. The reason I say mostly complete is because the webpage does not automatically reload when the add or delete buttons are hit. To get the changes to appear, you have to reload the webpage by clicking the reload button in the top left. Specifically, you have to hit the x to cancel the loading, and then reload. Then the changes will appear. Unfortunetly, I don't know how to trigger the app.Get function when the add or delete function are used. 

Other than that, the lab is pretty much done. While doing the lab, I also had way to much fun messing with the CSS to get the webpage to look horribly ugly. I figured, if there is extra credit for making the ugliest website, than I should try. There was no javascript test for this lab, so there is nothing to worry about there. For what I learned from the lab and module, it was mainly just what pug and express are, as well as how to use SQL, and why it's used.
